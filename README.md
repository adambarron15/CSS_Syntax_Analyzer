# CSS Syntax Analyzer
## A CS311 Project

A semester long project conducted by Adam Barron, Michael Mueller, and Winston Smith. Together they created a java-based program that would take in an input file of CSS code and validate it, printing out an error report or success message to the user. Together they worked together to incorporate a more intelligent Syntax Analyzer that would be able to help desribe to the user where there may be errors in their CSS document, in comparsion to some of the unreadible error reports offered by other validators like W3 schools. As it was only a semester project, it is not CSS complete, but encompasses nearly all of the language and can give better insight to error handling for the user.

If one would like to use/test this software, simply import the project into ecclipse (or an IDE of your choice) with a simple text file onhand as input with your CSS code. Insure it is in the projects folder and pass the name of the file and the program will pass you any errors that were thrown or an successs message.
