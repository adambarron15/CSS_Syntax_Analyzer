# CSS Syntax Analyzer
## A CS311 Project

This was a collaborative effort between Michael Mueller (thats me!), Adam Barron, and Winston Smith. We worked together to incorporate a more intelligent Syntax Analyzer that would be able to help desribe to the user where there may be errors in their CSS document, in comparsion to some of the unreadible error reports offered by other validators like W3 schools. As it was only a semester project, it is not CSS complete, but encompasses almost the entirety of the language and can give better insight to error handling for the user.

If one would like to use/test this software, simply import the project into ecclipse with a simple text file onhand as input with your CSS code. Insure it is in the projects folder and pass the name of the file and the program will pass you any errors that were thrown or an successs message.
